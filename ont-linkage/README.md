# ont-linkage

## Purpose
This tool serves two purposes:
- An example of how to use the Calix SMx REST API's `cli` endpoint
- A way to see how the ONT is registered to SMx

## Usage
After all the imports at the top of the file, you can set your parameters (lines 19-22 as of this writing). If one was so inclined, they could employ `argparse` or something more fancy than I've bothered to do. But, as stated above, the purpose of this is a proof-of-concept for using the `cli` endpoint.

To ensure that you can run this, first run:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
